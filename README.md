# macbookair2014

Two scripts for running Linux Mint 22.x / Ubuntu 24.04 on a 2014 MacBook Air
(MacBookAir6,1 / 6,2 — Haswell, 4GB RAM, BCM4360 Wi-Fi).

## `mba-wifi.sh`

Broadcom BCM4360 survival tool.

These Airs use a BCM4360 `[14e4:43a0]` on Apple's proprietary connector, so the
card cannot be swapped. Its only working driver is `wl`, built by DKMS from
`broadcom-sta-dkms` — a shim around a prebuilt binary Broadcom froze in 2015.
Kernel 7.x breaks the DKMS build (objtool rejects the blob,
[LP#2161038](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2161038)).

Because these laptops have no Ethernet port, a broken `wl` means no network at
all, including no way to fetch the fix. Two modes:

| Mode    | Purpose                                       | Risk           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `guard` | Keep the machine off 7.x and able to recover  | Safe, idempotent |
| `trial` | Deliberately test 7.x with a full undo path   | Risky, opt-in  |

```sh
sudo ./mba-wifi.sh help
```

## `optimize-mba.sh`

Memory and disk tuning for 4GB. In order: reclaim disk, drop Timeshift
snapshots, enable zram, tune VM sysctls for zram, install earlyoom, set
`noatime` on root, disable absent hardware, shrink the MySQL 8 footprint.

```sh
sudo ./optimize-mba.sh
```

The largest win is zram: zstd averages ~3:1, so a 3.8G zram device holds roughly
3.8G of pages in ~1.3G of real RAM. `vm.swappiness` is set *high* (180) on
purpose — swapping to compressed RAM is cheaper than evicting page cache.

Deliberately does **not** touch power management (TLP/ASPM/PPD), Apache/MySQL/PHP
as installed services, or any XFCE component.

### Old kernels

Never purged automatically. The script lists removable kernels — everything
except the running one and the newest — and asks which to remove, defaulting to
none. If there is no terminal to prompt on, it skips the step entirely.

Keep at least one known-good kernel. On these machines the previous kernel is
the recovery path: if a DKMS rebuild of `wl` fails, the older kernel is the only
way back to a working Wi-Fi card, and there is no Ethernet port to fall back on.

### Known rough edges

The MySQL section assumes `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/` exists. Disk-space figures
in the output are whatever `df` reports for `/`.

## `MACOS.md`

Whether OpenCore Legacy Patcher can run macOS newer than Apple's cutoff
(Big Sur) on this model. It can, up to Sequoia, and Haswell needs no graphics
root patches at any version — so SIP stays on and updates need no re-patching.
The only real obstacle is the 4GB of soldered RAM. Kept so the question stays
answered.
