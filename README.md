# macbookair2014

Two scripts for running Linux Mint 22.x / Ubuntu 24.04 on a 2014 MacBook Air
(MacBookAir6,1 / 6,2 — Haswell, 4GB RAM, BCM4360 Wi-Fi).

## `mba-wifi.sh`

Broadcom BCM4360 survival tool.

These Airs use a BCM4360 `[14e4:43a0]` on Apple's proprietary connector, so the
card cannot be swapped. Its only working driver is `wl`, built by DKMS from
`broadcom-sta-dkms` — a shim around a prebuilt binary Broadcom froze in 2015.
Kernel 7.x breaks the DKMS build (objtool rejects the blob,
[LP#2161038](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/2161038)).

Because these laptops have no Ethernet port, a broken `wl` means no network at
all, including no way to fetch the fix. Two modes:

| Mode    | Purpose                                       | Risk           |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| `guard` | Keep the machine off 7.x and able to recover  | Safe, idempotent |
| `trial` | Deliberately test 7.x with a full undo path   | Risky, opt-in  |

```sh
sudo ./mba-wifi.sh help
```

## `optimize-mba.sh`

Memory and disk tuning for 4GB. In order: reclaim disk, drop Timeshift
snapshots, enable zram, tune VM sysctls for zram, install earlyoom, set
`noatime` on root, disable absent hardware, shrink the MySQL 8 footprint.

```sh
sudo ./optimize-mba.sh
```

The largest win is zram: zstd averages ~3:1, so a 3.8G zram device holds roughly
3.8G of pages in ~1.3G of real RAM. `vm.swappiness` is set *high* (180) on
purpose — swapping to compressed RAM is cheaper than evicting page cache.

Deliberately does **not** touch power management (TLP/ASPM/PPD), Apache/MySQL/PHP
as installed services, or any XFCE component.

### Not yet portable

`optimize-mba.sh` purges a hardcoded list of obsolete kernel versions. That list
is specific to one machine and goes stale; the `dpkg -l | grep '^ii'` guard makes
it a harmless no-op elsewhere, but it also means it reclaims nothing. The MySQL
section assumes `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/` exists.
